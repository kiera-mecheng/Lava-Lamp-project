## üîß Overview  
This project combines design, prototyping, and hands-on creation to make a one-of-a-kind lava lamp using a repurposed Jack Daniels bottle. By applying SolidWorks modeling, sheet metal design, and 3D printing, I developed a custom base and solved real-world thermal challenges through problem-solving. The result is a functional and unique piece that blends engineering skills with creative design. 

## üìÖ Timeline  
- **Start:** February 2025  
- **End:** March 2025  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Materials  
- SolidWorks  
- Bamboo 3D Printer (PETG)  
- Aluminum cans (repurposed)  
- Old lava lamp (for parts)  
- High-temperature silicone adhesive (oven-safe)  
- Manual dimmer switch  

## üß† Skills Applied / Learned  
- Converting SolidWorks files into 3D-printable formats  
- Sheet metal design and duct geometry in SolidWorks  
- Prototyping with cardboard and aluminum  
- Problem solving and troubleshooting design failures  
- Practical application of thermal management principles  

## üß© Project Steps  

### 1. Planning & Research  
- Researched lava lamp fluid/wax formulas.  
- Investigated thermal shock risk (standard glass vs. Pyrex) ‚Üí determined safe due to slow heat-up.  
- Measured the Jack Daniels bottle and the original lava lamp base after modification.  
- Sketched several iterations of the new base, including a sheet metal circle-to-square duct design.  

### 2. Prototyping & Design  
- Created cardboard mock-ups to validate design feasibility.  
- Learned and applied SolidWorks sheet metal tools to model duct geometry.  
- Unfolded the sheet metal model for scale testing with aluminum sheet.  
- After consulting with a machinist, pivoted to a PETG 3D-printed design for better thermal performance.  

### 3. Fabrication & Assembly  
- Printed the PETG base and bonded parts with high-temperature silicone.  
- Mounted the Jack Daniels bottle into the new holding unit.  
- Initial testing revealed PETG absorbed too much heat, softening after ~1.5 hours.  
- Solution: integrated reflective aluminum layers cut from cans (4 per side) to redirect heat back into the glass.  

### 4. Finalization  
- Secured aluminum inserts with silicone and pressure-weighted them while curing.  
- Re-assembled the unit, spray-painted the base, and tested successfully as a functioning lava lamp.  

## Challenges & Fixes  
- **Challenge:** PETG softened under prolonged heat exposure, absorbing instead of reflecting heat.  
- **Fix:** Added multiple layers of repurposed aluminum cans inside the holding unit to redirect heat into the glass.

## üìù What I‚Äôd Do Differently  
If I repeated this project, I would pursue the original sheet metal bending design for the holding unit instead of relying on PETG. This would eliminate the need for aluminum can reinforcements and improve long-term thermal durability.
